      " Nasal swab tests are often negative for Covid-Omicron XBB, and cases of false negative nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.\n",

      " This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory distress.\n",
      "\n",
      " This explains why the Covid-Omicron XBB has become something very contagious, highly virulent and lethal.\n",
      "\n",
      " Caution, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5 m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, wash hands frequently, even if everyone is asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing).\n",

      "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Chalet Hotels \n",
      " \n",
      "We initiate coverage on Chalet Hotels Ltd (Chalet) with a ‘BUY’ rating, as it is a play on expected recovery in business travel complemented by an exposure to annuity business (18% share by FY25E) that acts as a hedge to deeply cyclical hospitality industry. We believe Chalet is best placed to ride the industry upcycle as it has 1) strategically located metro centric hotel portfolio where threat of new room supply is low (new supply CAGR of 6% over next 5 years in key metro cities) and 2) requisite pricing power amid affiliation with marquee global brands like Marriott and Novotel. Chalet has plans to add 88/168 rooms in Pune/Hyderabad which along with improvement in RevPAR is likely to drive hotel revenues at 12% CAGR over FY23E-FY25E, whereas annuity business is likely to grow at a CAGR of 78% over the same period amid addition of ~1.4mn sq ft of leasable area at Mumbai and Bangalore. \n",
      " \n",
      "Outlook \n",
      " \n",
      "Overall, we expect revenue/PAT CAGR of 19%/68% over FY23E-FY25E and recommend ‘BUY’ with a SOTP based TP of Rs455. We value hotels business at 16x FY25E EBITDA, annuity business at a cap rate of 10% and residential project in Bangalore at NAV of Rs15 per share.\n",

      "These days, Tuesdays appear to be favourable since the Finnifty Expiry gives traders, particularly scalpers, some volatility to play with in the afternoon. Get ready for some plodding moves in today's action; even the index won't know why I'm going higher or lower. Our markets need some new triggers because they are completely worn out. Despite Dow Futures firing during market hours, our markets recovered but didn't fully contribute to the Dow Rally. Due to the Dow's complete loss last night, our markets will either be weak or in a sideways trend. The best course of action is to remain away until we see clear-cut Volume moves because tomorrow can bring bigger possibilities with Expiry in Play. Overall as a Buyer, it might be a day to avoid.\n",

According to the Economic Times, the company is seeking a 15-20% premium from its last funding round, valuing its EV subsidiary, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility at cUSD10.9b. This follows a USD1b funding round in 2021 with TPG's Rise Climate Fund and Abu Dhabi's ADQ. As per the article, Tata is currently in preliminary discussions with several high-profile investors, impact funds, sovereign wealth funds, and Canadian pension funds for the funding.\n",

      "In this report, we examine banks’ exposure to Adani group debt. The key message is that Indian banking exposure is less than 40% of total group debt. Within this, private banks’ exposure is below 10% of total group debt and most banks (including ICICI/Axis) have indicated that they have largely financed assets with strong cashflows, such as airports/ports. PSU banks do have material exposure (30% of group debt) but this debt has not increased in the past three years. Most of the incremental funding to the group for new businesses and acquisitions has come via overseas sources. To conclude, the ballpark exposure of private banks is 0.3% of FY24 loans and 1.5% of FY24 networth. For PSU banks, the exposure is 0.7% of FY24 loans and 6% of FY24 networth.\n",

      "1) New Life Insurance policies > 5 lacs aggregate premium - Proceeds are now taxable (For ULIPs this was already at 2.5 lacs ) \n",
      "Impact - Traditional Insurance becomes unfavourable from 1st April. Rush to buy before 31st March'23\n",
      "\n",
      "2) \tREITs / InvITs - Change in taxation for Repayment of debt. Now even this component in distribution is taxable For e.g.: some REITs give income as a large part as this. So that is a negative \n",
      "Impact - REIT prices should fall a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Market Linked Debentures (MLDs) / Structured Products will now be fully taxed as short-term capital gains. Earlier taxation on this was 10% and treated as Long term gains This was Impact: This anomaly is now dead. \n",
      "Impact - MLDs will also die (negative for wealth/investment product manufacturers).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Finance Minister is clearly pushing for everyone to shift to New tax regime i.e. no deductions Sec 80 C benefits like ELSS, PPF, NPS etc will not be available if you shift to New Tax Regime Impact - More money in hands of investors, but lesser savings (individual call).\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Another negative one for very *ultra-HNIs*: Capital Gains > 10 Cr will not get benefit of Sec 54F This means if you sell a house / stake in a company, and gains are more then 10 Cr (will not affect small investors) then max benefit is till 10 Cr when you invest in another property etc\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Winnings from Online Gaming had TDS but many used to circumvent it. Now this is plugged. \n",
      "\n",
      "7) International Investing: If you have been investing abroad through LRS (Liberalised Remittance), the TDS is now increased to 20%. This will be a big impact Earlier TDS was only 5% and that too if > 7 lacs. Now it is flat 20% Impact - Negative for global investing\n",

      "\"There was a time we were wooing British business people to invest in India. Now I see the British government wooing Indians to invest in the UK. This has been a quantum change in the dynamics of the world and this had to have its repercussions,\" the senior lawyer said.\n",

This is the way some people like making their money, by coming up with such allegations,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harish Salve also said that India lacks a legal framework to take on a company like Hindenburg. \"Where India lacks is that in India we don't have the legal framework to take on an Hindenburg. If we sue them for damages, Gautam Adani's grandchildren will be fighting the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ace lawyer said that when you have an FPO coming is the best time to throw ink. \"Till the time the market continues in this volatile condition, there is bound to be an erosion of confidence. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and trust, and a moment to destroy it,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salve also lauded Adani Group's decision to call off the Rs 20,000-crore Follow-on Public Offer (FPO) and return the proceeds to investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has done a wonderful thing by withdrawing the FPO because the retail investor should not suffer. For the next few weeks, the shares will tank. They will try and control it, but the shares will tank. These allegations will be investigated and thrown out in time and confidence will be rebuilt. But in the meantime, Hindenburg gets away with it,\" he said.\n",

      "Harish Salve suggested that Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) should call Gautam Adani and sit with him for 72 hours and say yes, there are areas of concern or no, this report is nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said that Sebi's report should 100 per cent be made public. \"Sebi should tell the investors, don’t panic, we will investigate and give a report. Sebi is meant to control markets and instill confidence in the investors,\" Salve said.\n",

      "\n",
      "- In 2020/21 when VC funding was at its peak, SVB saw a massive influx of deposits. Their deposit book jumped from $61.76bn at the end of 2019 to $189.20bn at the end of 2021 (Imagine 300% growth in 3 years)\n",

      "-Market sensed this and people started withdrawing deposits from bank. To meet customers withdrawal request, SVB announced yesterday that they had sold $21bn of their Available For Sale (AFS) securities at a $1.8bn loss, and were raising another $2.25bn in equity and debt.\n",
      "\n",

      "12/03/23, 1:47 pm - +91 98339 78169: What’s Going on With Silicon Valley Bank?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some questions and answers to help explain what happened\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸How did we get here?\n",
      "\n",
      "SVB Financial is the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, which counts many startups and venture-capital firms as clients. During the pandemic, those clients generated a ton of cash that led to a surge in deposits. SVB ended the first quarter of 2020 with just over $60 billion in total deposits. That skyrocketed to just shy of $200 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸What did the bank do?\n",
      "\n",
      "SVB Financial bought tens of billions of dollars of seemingly safe assets, primarily longer-term U.S. Treasurys and government-backed mortgage securities. SVB’s securities portfolio rose from about $27 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to around $128 billion by the end of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Why is that a problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "These securities are at virtually no risk of defaulting. But they pay fixed interest rates for many years. That isn’t necessarily a problem, unless the bank suddenly needs to sell the securities. Because market interest rates have moved so much higher, those securities are suddenly worth less on the open market than they are valued at on the bank’s books. As a result, they could only be sold at a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "SVB’s unrealized losses on its securities portfolio at the end of 2022—or the gap between the cost of the investments and their fair value—jumped to more than $17 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸What else went wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, SVB’s deposit inflows turned to outflows as its clients burned cash and stopped getting new funds from public offerings or fundraisings. Attracting new deposits also became far more expensive, with the rates demanded by savers increasing along with the Fed’s hikes. Deposits fell from nearly $200 billion at the end of March 2022 to $173 billion at year-end 2022.\n",
      "And that is accelerating this year: As of Jan. 19, SVB was forecasting its deposits would decline by a midsingle-digit percentage in 2023. But their expectation as of March 8 was for a low-double-digit percentage decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸How did this come to a head?\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday SVB said it had sold a large chunk of its securities, worth $21 billion at the time of sale, at a loss of about $1.8 billion after tax. The bank’s aim was to help it reset its interest earnings at today’s higher yields, and also provide it with the balance-sheet flexibility to meet potential outflows and still fund new lending. It also set out to raise about $2.25 billion in capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Why didn’t it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following that announcement on Wednesday evening, things seemed to get even worse for the bank. The share-sale announcement led the stock to crater in price, making it harder to raise capital and leading the bank to scuttle its share-sale plans, The Wall Street Journal has reported. And venture-capital firms reportedly began advising their portfolio companies to withdraw deposits from SVB.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸What will happen to customer deposits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the bank’s deposits are sizable enough that they don’t carry Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protection. SVB said it estimates that at the end of 2022 the amount of deposits in its U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit was $151.5 billion.\n",
      "The FDIC said in a statement on Friday that customers will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning. The FDIC said it hadn’t yet determined the current amount of uninsured deposits. But it said that uninsured depositors will get an advance dividend within the next week. For the remaining amounts of uninsured funds, those depositors will get something called a “receivership certificate,” and as the FDIC sells off the assets of SVB, they may get future dividend payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Why are other bank stocks getting hit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Already rattled by the failure of Silvergate Capital, whose own problems started with crypto but also reflected a portfolio of government debt whose value was depressed by higher rates, investors are selling bank stocks across the board. Stocks of other midsize lenders such as First Republic Bank and Signature Bank were halted as well.\n",

      " As financial year is coming to end, if you have earned well in Stock Market in FY 2022-23 and now you’re planning to pay tax on profit then *Tax Loss Harvesting* Opportunity is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax-loss Harvesting is a practice of selling Stocks those incurred a loss (stocks with un-realized losses in portfolio) to help investors reduce or offset taxes on any capital gains income subject to taxation. This practice is accomplished by harvesting the loss. The sold stock can be bought back or replaced by a similar one next day.\n",
      "\n",
      " *Example Scenario:* \n",
      "\n",
      "If an individual earns up to ₹1 lakh in Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) this year, they must pay 15% of this amount as taxes, which amounts to ₹15,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if the individual holds stocks with an unrealized loss of ₹60,000, they can sell these stocks to reduce their net STCG to ₹40,000. This would require paying 15% of ₹40,000, which amounts to ₹6,000 in taxes, resulting in a tax savings of ₹9,000.\n",
      "\n",
      " *Points to remember :* \n",
      "\n",
      "•\tIf you are selling loss making stocks and want to buy them again in the same account then let the settlement cycle complete and buy it after that (Now settlement cycle takes just 1 day).\n",
      "•\tYou can also buy the stocks on the same day, but for that if you’re selling from your own account then you will have to buy the same from any other family account.\n",
      "\n",
      " *Things should know :* \n",
      "\n",
      "Long term capital gains/loss = for holding period more than 1 year\n",
      "Short term capital gains/loss = for holding period less than 1 year\n",
      "\n",
      " If profits are 1 lakh in a financial year is exempt as Long term capital gains. So book profits in shares & mutual funds together up to 1 lakh, and reinvest in it.\n",
      " If profits are more than 1 lakh, check if you can book loss in any of the holdings to set off. You can buy back the next day.\n",
      " Short term capital gains are taxed at 15%, book losses and buy back next day to set off any profits.\n",
      " Both Long and short term losses can be carried forward for 8 years. So booking losses can helps to save future taxes. (Make sure you file Income Tax returns on time).\n",
      " Long term capital losses can be set off against Long term capital Gain only. Short term capital losses can be set off against Short Term and Long Term capital gains.\n",
      " If shares are bought prior to 31 Jan 2018, you can take actual cost or the price as on 31 Jan 2018 whichever is higher. This can reduce your capital gain. However, no notional loss can be claimed.\n",

       " \" *XBB variant*\\n\\n Let's pay attention to the following information:\\n\\n Everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new variant of the COVID-Omicron XBB coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect correctly.\\n\\n The symptoms of the new virus COVID-Omicron XBB are the following:\\n\\n     1. There is no cough.\\n     2. There is no fever.\\n\\n   There will only be a limited number of these others:\\n\\n     3. Joint pain.\\n     4. Headache.\\n     5. Pain in the neck.\\n     6. Upper back pain.\\n     7. Pneumonia.\\n     8. There is usually no appetite.\\n\\n\\n COVID-Omicron XBB is 5 times more virulent than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than it.\\n\\n It takes less time for the condition to reach extreme severity and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.\\n\\n Let's be more careful!\\n\\n This strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region and directly affects the lungs for a relatively short period of time.\\n\\n Several patients diagnosed with Covid-Omicron XBB were classified as afebrile and pain free, but x-rays showed mild chest pneumonia.\\n\\n Nasal swab tests are often negative for Covid-Omicron XBB, and cases of false negative nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.\\n\\n This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory distress.\\n\\n This explains why the Covid-Omicron XBB has become something very contagious, highly virulent and lethal.\\n\\n Caution, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5 m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, wash hands frequently, even if everyone is asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing).\\n\\n This wave of Covid-Omicron XBB is deadlier than the first wave of Covid-19.  So we have to be very careful and take several reinforced precautions against the coronavirus.\\n\\n Maintain vigilant communication with your friends and family.\\n\\n Do not keep this information to yourself, please share it with other family members and friends.\\n\",\n",
